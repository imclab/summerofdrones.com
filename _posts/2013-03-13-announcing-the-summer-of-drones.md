title: Announcing the Summer of Drones
---

Today we are very happy to announce the Summer of Drones!

The Summer of Drones is an epic series of up to 34
[Nodecopter](http://nodecopter.com/) community events to take place in North
America and Europe from June to September 2013.

Our goal is to highlight the non-military potential of
[UAVs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle), bring together
people from different programming communities, and learn some interesting new
stuff while having fun with flying robots.

Have a look at some videos from the first Nodecopter event that was held in
Berlin on Oct 5th, 2012 to get an idea for what to expect:
