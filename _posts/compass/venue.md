A venue for a NodeCopter event should ideally meet the following requirements:

* **Flying area**: a separate flying area is great to play
  around with drones, try out the programs and should prevent drones from
  crashing into people.

* **High ceiling**: a flying area with a low ceiling doesn't make a lot of sense
  when there are programmed NodeCopters flying around. Ideal would be a minimum
  height of 4 meters (13 feet).

* **Great hacking space**: attendees are going to program their drones, so be
  sure to provide an area where they can sit down and hack.

* **Stable WiFi**: it's safe to say that there will be on average a minimum
  of two WiFi-capable devices per attendee (computer, phone, tablet, ...). And
  every drone that is powered on will open its own wi-fi. Be sure your venue's
  WiFi can handle this!

* **Electricity**: be sure there are enough power sockets and enough power splitters.
  People need to recharge their computers and their phones, and you need too hook
  up the rechargers for the batteries somewhere. You don't want to run out of fully
  charged batteries when people are doing crazy stuff with their drones!

* **Projector and screen**: for the introductory talk at the beginning of a
  NodeCopter event a projector and a screen are really great. And when it's time
  for the demos most attendes will need a projector to show of what they built.

* **Floor**: To avoid drifting, your floor should have a clear texture. If you
  have a very homogenous floor, use tape (e.g. masking tape) to give it a texture.
  Ideally there shouldn't be a carpet, as they usually have a bad impact on the
  ultrasonic sensors the drones use.

In general it's recommended to bring your drone to the venue beforehand and do
some test flights.

**Pro**:

* The abandoned public swimming baths were **huge**! There was plenty of space
  to fly around!
* The hacking area was totally separated from the flying area: attendees were
  sitting besides the empty pool in which the drones where flying.

**Contra**:

* The electricity in that old building wasn't the best. We essentially had a
  couple of power sockets and needed loads of power splitters to make this work.

* It was cold since it takes a lot of time and effort to heat up such a huge
  hall at the beginning of October.

**Pro**:

* The hacking spaces were really comfortable: you had a choice between
  working at a normal desk or sitting on a couch.

* Separate flying and hacking areas.

**Contra**:

* Even though the venue had high ceilings it also had some metal bars on the
  ceilings, which a lot of NodeCopters hit eventually.
