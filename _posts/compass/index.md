<h2 id="crazy-epic-2013"><a href="#crazy-epic-2013">CRAZY, EPIC THINGS IN 2013</a></h2>

We are planning some **crazy, epic things** for May - June next year. Until
then, we are only supporting [MiniNodeCopter](/compass/mininodecopter) events.

If you want to be part of the big thing, [get in touch](mailto:core@nodecopter.com).

<h2 id="qualifications"><a href="#qualifications">Qualifications</a></h2>

In order to organize an event using the nodecopter name and brand for the first
time, you must follow these steps:

1. **Attend** at least one nodecopter event.
2. **Get** at least one existing organizer to provide oversight.
3. **Read** all information on these pages.
4. **Send an email** to [core@nodecopter.com](mailto:core@nodecopter.com) to
  discuss your event **before** announcing it.

Any event not coordinated with us must not call itself nodecopter and
will receive no support from the nodecopter network of volunteers.

<h2 id="values"><a href="#values">Core Values</a></h2>

Anybody organizing an event should agree with this:

* NodeCopter is a **community event** (affordable & inclusive)
* NodeCopter is **non-profit** (all money goes into the events)
* NodeCopter is about **learning**, **sharing** and **fun** (be nice)

To ensure that all events follow these values, the [core copter](/core) team
provides benevolent dictatorship for all events.
