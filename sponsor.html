      <h1>Sponsor The Summer of Drones</h1>
<p>Thank you for your interest in sponsoring the summer of drones. This document
outlines the plans for the project, as well as the available sponsorship
opportunities.

</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The summer of drones is a series of events scheduled for June - September 2013
to take place in North America and Europe.

</p>
<p>Each event will have up to 60 developers get together for a full day of
programming flying robots with JavaScript (or other languages).

</p>
<p>The individual events will be organized by community members, and judging from
the initial interest we should be able to schedule one event every weekend in
North America and Europe each. This would allow for up to 30 events total
attended by almost 2000 developers.

</p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>On October 5th, 2012 we organized an event in Berlin called
<a href="http://nodecopter.com/">NodeCopter</a>. The event was incredibly successful, and
thanks to being pre-event of <a href="http://2012.jsconf.eu/">JSConf.eu</a>, attended by
a very international audience.

</p>
<p>After the event many attendees and followers on the internet contacted us about
bringing similar events to their cities, which resulted in additional events
that took place in Dublin, San Francisco, Seatle and Brighton.

</p>
<p>However, organizing these individual events is very in-efficient and costly, so
we created the Summer of Drones to reduce the costs for individual events from
$10.000 to $1.000 and to enable a large amount of events.

</p>
<p>The primary benefit from these events is education. Developers who are usually
involved in the front- or backend aspects of web development are given the
chance to learn about robotics, which is a fun way to discover new
algorithms and techniques that are suprisingly related to the design of
distributed systems.

</p>
<p>As part of the summer of drones, we are extending our educational mission to
the next generation of programmers. This is done by donating all purchased drones
and equipment to <a href="http://coderdojo.com/">Coder Dojos</a> around the world after
the project ends in September.

</p>
<p>Additionally, any remaining budget will be donated to the <a href="http://hwf.io/">Hello
World foundation</a>, which is a new organization dedicated to
support the technical education of children around the world.

</p>
<h2>Budget</h2>
<p>All sponsorship money will be used to cover the following costs:

</p>
<ul>
<li>Purchase of 60 <a href="http://ardrone2.parrot.com/">Parrot AR.Drones 2.0</a> (30 for
each continent)</li>
<li>Purchase of sufficient repair components</li>
<li>Costs for printing promotional materials including T-Shirts, Banners, etc.</li>
<li>Costs to support local events with costs for shipping, venues, etc.
(individual events will try to raise most of this money themselves, but we
will help in case of problems)</li>
<li>Dealing with unexpected problems</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to finance the project, we aim to raise a budget of <strong>~30.000 EUR</strong>.

</p>
<p>Everybody involved is a volunteer, and the ticket prices will be as affordable
as possible (30-40 EUR).

</p>
<p>Any additionaly money will be used to improve the events, and any remaining
budget will be donated to the <a href="http://hwf.io/">Hello World foundation</a>.
