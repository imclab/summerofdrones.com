[nodecopter](http://nodecopter.com/) events for over 1500 developers to
take place from June - September 2013.

  <input class="button" type="submit" value="Keep me posted" />
</form>

## How?

The nodecopter [core team](http://nodecopter.com/core) team is reaching out to
sponsors buy ~60 [drones](http://ardrone2.parrot.com/) and repair parts to be
shipped from event to event in North America and Europe.

Each continent will have its own set of ~30 drones, so there will be 2 events
every Saturday!

## Bring an event to your City

The best way to make sure there will be an event in your city is to organize it!
We're going to make it ridiculously easy and cheap. Here is what you need to do:

* Pick a date from the list below
* E-Mail us [core@nodecopter.com](core@nodecopter.com) - dates will be assigned
  on a first-come, first-serve basis
* Find a suitable [venue](http://nodecopter.com/compass/venue)
* Raise enough money to pay for shipping (~300 USD) + your venue ($0 - $5000)

That's pretty much it. We are working on detailed information for everything,
so you should be able to pull of an event very easily.

The only thing you need to promise is to allow for enough time on the day after
the event (Sunday) to pack/repair the drones so you can ship them to the next
event on Monday.

## FAQ

### This is crazy, why are you doing this?

A group of out-of-space robots has asked us to organize these events for them.
They promised that they are coming in peace and that they just want to spend
the summer with us - what could go wrong?

### You mentioned repairing the drones, is that hard?

No! It is super simple, and there are [detailed
videos](http://blog.parrot.com/2012/06/01/ar-drone-2-0-repair-videos/) showing
you the steps. Every drone set will also include a generous amount of repair
parts, but generally speaking only the indoor hull breaks often, and that is
easily fixed with some special tape.

### Can we use programming languages other than JavaScript?

Yes! We welcome developers from all languages and plattforms. Most languages
already have AR Drone libraries available, so use whatever you like!

### Can we use our own quad copters / other robots?

Yes! As long as your robots can behave and don't endager the other participants,
you're free to hack on any robots you like. It would be especially awesome to
see different robots collaborate.
