<h2 id="about">The Summer of Drones</h2>

The Summer of Drones is an epic series of up to 34
[Nodecopter](http://nodecopter.com/) community events to take place in North
America and Europe from June to September 2013.

Our goal is to highlight the non-military potential of
[UAVs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle), bring together
people from different programming communities, and learn some interesting new
stuff while having fun with flying robots.

Have a look at some videos from the first Nodecopter event that was held in
Berlin on Oct 5th, 2012 to get an idea for what to expect:

<h2 id="attend">Attend an Event</h2>

You know JavaScript, Ruby, Python, Java, Objective C, C++, C#, Perl, Go, Clojure,
or Scala? Heck, even Bash will do.

As long as your language of choice can do networking, you should consider
attending an event close to you. There is also no need for previous robotics
experience as long as you are passionate and curious!

We are going to announce the first dates and cities very soon, so make sure
to get notified:
