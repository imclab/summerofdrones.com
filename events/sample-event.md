<hr class="big" />

## Location & time

Tell your attendees about your venue here, including the full address, directions, a google maps link and potentially one or more images so that people can recognize the building. Also let them know when they are expected to be at the building and if there is an end time.

Example text:

<div class="example-text">
  <p>Join us in programming flying robots the whole day in [[city]]!
We'll meet around [[insert meetup time here]] and the event is expected to start at [[insert start time here]]. There is no fixed end time.</p>

  <p>The event will be held at [[insert full location here]]. You can find directions here: [[google maps link]]</p>

  <p>Looking forward to seeing you all there!</p>
</div>

## Sign up

Event page visitors should have a clear way to sign up for your event. You may want to integrate Tito (recommended) or create a google docs sign up form. This is totally up to you. If you need any help with this, please contact the core team.

Please also list relevant ticket prices here.

## Event plan

List out everything that could potentially be relevant to your attendees and their families. Here are a few ideas:

<ul>
  <li>What are your plans regarding food &amp; drinks? Will you have food at the venue? Or will you organize that during the event?</li>
  <li>How are teams formed? Can people bring their own team mates or are teams formed randomly? How many people are in a team? (Should not be more than 3, but depends on how many people you want to invite.)</li>
  <li>Is there anything that attendees need to bring to your event?</li>
  <li>What are people expected to code at the event? Are there specific prepared challenges? Or can they hack on whatever they want with the drones?</li>
  <li>Are teams expected to demo their stuff? If so, when will be demo time?</li>
</ul>

## Team & Contact

If possible, please insert pictures of organizer team members here. This makes it easier for attendees to recognize organizers when they come to the venue.

Linking your twitter accounts and possibly email addresses here would also be a great help, since attendees may get lost trying to find the building or might have last minute questions. It's also easier to organize evening meet-ups this way.

## Sponsors

Please list out all your event sponsors here, possibly including their logo and website link.
