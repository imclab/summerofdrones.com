<h3 id="finding-sponsors"><a href="#finding-sponsors">Finding sponsors</a></h3>

<p>If you can find enough sponsors to cover all your costs, that would be truly awesome. From our experience it is best to contact local tech companies for this. Quite often they are more than willing to help out with such an awesome tech event - you just need to contact them.

</p>
<p>They might also send a few people to the event as well, which in turn helps reaching the required amount of attendees.

</p>
<p>Unfortunately, sponsors do not get to keep the drones after the events this time. Instead we are thinking about donating them to <a href="http://coderdojo.com">CoderDojo</a> once the &quot;Summer of Drones&quot; is over. There is nothing better than helping to raise the next generation of software developers.

</p>
<p>However, you can offer different sponsor benefits, like banners, the ability to name the venue&#39;s Wifi connection, sponsoring the food, etc. If you need help finding sponsors, you can always drop us a line at <a href="core@nodecopter.com">core@nodecopter.com</a>.

</p>
<p>It&#39;s a good idea to think hard about what you can offer your sponsors. Make sure to treat them exceptionally well. They are the ones who make your event possible.

<h3 id="selling-tickets"><a href="#selling-tickets">Selling tickets</a></h3>

<p>If you can&#39;t find enough sponsors to cover all your costs, don&#39;t worry, that&#39;s fine. You can sell tickets instead. A good ticket price would be between 20 and 30 USD. We suggest that you do not price your tickets more expensive than 30 USD. After all we want to make this less expensive, and more epic for your attendees.



</p>
<p>With 40 people showing up at the event and a ticket price of 30 USD, you can raise 1200 USD, which should be between 30% and 50% of your budget already.

</p>
<p>You are free to sell tickets however you like. We recommend using services like <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/">Eventbrite</a> to make selling tickets a breeze and to receive the money upfront.

</p>
<h3 id="ways-for-money"><a href="#ways-for-money">Other ways to raise money</a></h3>

<p>If you can&#39;t or don&#39;t want to raise money via sponsors or selling tickets, that&#39;s fine. This is your event and you are free to raise money for it in whichever way you like.

</p>
<p>However, in order to ensure that everything is in sync with the spirit of and the idea behind the &quot;Summer of Drones&quot;, please drop us a line at <a href="core@nodecopter.com">core@nodecopter.com</a> before you execute your fundraising idea.
