      <h2 id="budget"><a href="#budget">Budget</a></h2>

<p>There are essentially only three big items that you need to budget for:

</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#venue">Venue</a> (0 - 5000 USD)</li>
<li><a href="#drinks-and-lunch">Drinks and lunch</a> (25 - 50 USD / person)</li>
<li><a href="#shipping">Shipping</a> (~300 USD)</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally you should add an extra ~15% to your budget for overhead:

</p>
<ul>
<li>Unexpected problems</li>
<li>Power splitters</li>
<li>Extra drinks for visitors in the evening</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want a quick estimate, check our <a href="#example">example budget</a>.

</p>
<h3 id="venue"><a href="#venue">Venue</a></h3>

<p>Ideally you can find a local company to provide a <a href="/compass/venue">nice venue</a>
for free.

</p>
<p>If you cannot find a free venue, you should:

</p>
<ul>
<li>Look at many different venues and compare prices</li>
<li>Be prepared to spend between 0 USD and 5000 USD</li>
<li>Try to get a discount for doing something amazing</li>
</ul>
<p>Some venues may also like the idea of people taking photos &amp; videos of their
venue from positions &amp; angles that are only reachable with the drones.

</p>
<h3 id="drinks-and-lunch"><a href="#drinks-and-lunch">Drinks and lunch</a></h3>

<p>To let people focus on programming the drones, you should provide drinks
(water, soft drinks, maybe beer in the evening) and lunch. You can do this in one of two ways:

</p>
<ul>
<li>Buy food &amp; drinks from the venue: This will most likely be more expensive,
but it easier to coordinate and some venues will require it.</li>
<li><strong>Recommended:</strong> Buy drinks &amp; order delivery food yourself: This is
cheaper and more flexible, but requires a little more work.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="shipping"><a href="#shipping">Shipping</a></h3>

<p>We require you to ship your drone set (20 drones) to the organizer of the even that takes place <strong>two weeks after your event</strong>. You can calculate this to be around 10 - 15 USD per drone, so around 300 USD altogether.


</p>
<h3 id="example"><a href="#example-budget">Example Budget</a></h3>



<p>Here is an example calculation for an event with 40 people:

</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lunch:</strong> 40 x 15 USD = <strong>600 USD</strong></li>
<li><strong>Drinks:</strong> 56 x 15 USD = <strong>840 USD</strong> (40 attendees plus 16 visitors)</li>
<li><strong>Shipping:</strong> 20 x 15 USD = <strong>300 USD</strong> (for 20 drones)</li>
<li><strong>Venue:</strong> 1 x 2000 USD = <strong>2000 USD</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Total:</strong> 3740 USD (hard costs) + 561 USD (15% overhead) = <strong>4301 USD</strong>

</p>
<p>This is just an example, but <strong>3500 USD - 5000 USD</strong> is a reasonable ball
bark for most &quot;Summer of Drones&quot; events.

</p>
<p>But don&#39;t be scared, on the <a href="/compass/financing">finacing page</a> you will find some advice on how you can pull this off.
